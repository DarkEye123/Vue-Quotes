Example of component usage/implementation using Vue

This is my (JS/Vue side) implementation of the second project of this course.

I tried to use concept of event bus for child-2-child communication so my structure
is quite different (more complex) apart the one in the course itself.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
